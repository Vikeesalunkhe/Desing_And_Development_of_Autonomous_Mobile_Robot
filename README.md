# Design And Development Of Autonomous Mobile Robot For Food Delivery In Restaurants

Welcome to the Autonomous Mobile Robot project repository. This project focuses on the design, development, and implementation of an autonomous mobile robot using ROS (Robot Operating System) for navigation and control.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an autonomous food delivery robot with the capability to deliver customer orders. Initially, the plan included designing an Android app for customers to place orders. However, due to the lack of documentation on ROS and Android integration and time constraints, the project shifted towards implementing an alternative approach. The chosen method involves the robot autonomously navigating a cluttered restaurant space, dynamically re-planning its path from the home location to customer tables, delivering orders, and finally returning to its home base.

The primary focus is on creating a seamless and efficient food delivery system, optimizing the robot's navigation in complex environments. The project strives to enhance customer experience through reliable autonomous delivery and obstacle-avoidance mechanisms.


## Specifications
* The robot should establish bidirectional communication with a laptop using a designated transceiver setup.
* The robot must possess the capability to detect and process images obtained from the designated transceiver.
* The robot should demonstrate autonomous navigation from its home location to specified customer tables and back.
* The robot needs to dynamically adjust its path in response to detecting new obstacles within the environment.
* The robot should incorporate a feature to play varied music based on received feedback.

## The steps involved in this project have been described in detail as follows:-

1. *Modeling in fusion 360 and Converting into URDF file to run in GAZEBO simulator.*
2. *Gazebo Plugins*
3. *Intro to R-viz and RQT graphs*
4. *SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping)*
5. *Navigation Stack to Self-design robot*

### *Sample*

‚Ä¢  We used fusion 360 software for designing and developing the robot and then that design model has been converted into a URDF file.

### *Final model in Fusion360*

## ROS (Robot Operating System) Information

### Installation

Make sure you have ROS Noetic installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official ROS website](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation).

## ROS Navigation

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

SLAM was implemented to allow the robot to create a map of its environment while navigating.

#### Gmapping Setup

To implement SLAM, the `gmapping` package was used. The robot was teleoperated to explore the environment, and the map was generated using the following steps:

1. Start Gazebo: `roslaunch your_robot_package gazebo.launch`
2. Start Teleoperation: `rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py`
3. Run Gmapping Node: `rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=/scan`
4. Visualize the Map in RVIZ.

#### Map Saving

After successful mapping, the map was saved using the `map_server` package:

```bash
rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/catkin_ws/src/your_robot_package/maps/map_name
```
